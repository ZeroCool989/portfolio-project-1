                        As a beginner in the field of web development, I am excited to dive into the world of full stack development. I knew that this would be a challenging journey, but I was ready to take on the challenge.
        
                        I started by building a strong foundation in web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also picking up a programming language, I chose to learn Python, as it is widely used in web development and has a large community. Additionally, I am learning about web frameworks like  Django, and Flask which make it easier to structure and develop web applications.
        
                        Next steps are to dive into the back-end development and to learn about databases and SQL. I also using Git, a version control system, which is essential to keep track of my code and collaborating with other developers.
        
                        I also planning to get hands-on experience in server-side development and deployment. This included setting up and configuring a web server, and learning how to deploy and scale web applications.
        
                        To improve my skills, I started a full-stack diplome degree at Code Institute and participated in coding challenges. This helps me to gain practical experience and improve my skills.
        
                        Overall, becoming a full stack developer requires a broad set of skills and technologies, but with dedication and practice, I am confident that I will become a successful full stack developer.
